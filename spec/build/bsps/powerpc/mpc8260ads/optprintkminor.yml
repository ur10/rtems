  (BSP--console driver) Must be defined to be one of SMC1_MINOR, SMC2_MINOR, SCC2_MINOR, SCC3_MINOR, or SCC4_MINOR. Determines which device is used for output by printk(). If the port that printk() uses is also used for other I/O (e.g. if  PRINTK_MINOR == \$CONSOLE_MINOR), then both ports should use the same type of I/O, otherwise the drivers will likely conflict with each other.
